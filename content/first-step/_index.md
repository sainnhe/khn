To get started with the development of a large project, you need to complete at least the following three steps first:

1. Setup your development environment, including code completion, code linting, etc.
2. Build and run the project locally.
3. Modify at least one line of code and see the effect of the modification.

This chapter will focus on these three topics. We will discuss how to configure your code editors, how to build the kernels and modify the source code to print a "Hello world!" string.
